# MotiHomeT

MotiHomeT is an android app designed to automatically count push-ups. It utilizes pose estimation to calculate different metrics about the body of a user, which in turn is used to count push-ups. The user can log into this app, save the amount of push-ups they do and compete with their friends.

We hope that by removing the hassle to count your push-ups by hand and by being able to compete with your friends you will stay motivated to do push-ups for a long time to come!

## Installation

Clone this github repo and open it in android studio. Then build the application and run it on your android smartphone.

## Usage

When opening the app, it will ask you to enter your id. You can choose this id freely. If you want to count your push-ups, simply press 'start'. The app will ask you for camera permissions which you have to accept. Proceed by placing the phone vertically on the floor(for example lean your phone on a wall). The phone should face your side and the camera should be able to see your whole body for the best results. 
**Then simply start doing push-ups!**
The app will count them automatically. If you want to compare the amount of push-ups you did with your friends, press the 'plus' icon in the top right corner of the screen and input the id of your friend.
